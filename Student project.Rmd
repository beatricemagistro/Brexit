Our research project investigates which individual factors are more likely to be associated with a Brexit vote. We will examine whether economic or cultural explanations affect more an anti-EU stance. We will rely on two different datasets to test our hypotheses and we will also eventually use official data from the Referendum to check whether cross-regionally Brexit votes corresponded with dependent variables, that try to measure the Brexit vote as close as possible.

The two datasets we will be using are the Eurobarometer and the European Social Survey. We will use the May 2015 Eurobarometer wave and the 2014 European Social Survey wave.
