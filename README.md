The R file EB16 contains the analysis for the EB data from 2016.
Something is wrong with the variable occup_scale which measures what kind of occupation each person has. If I add it to the model, standard errors become huge. If I remove it, everything works fine. I am still not sure why that happens but we should investigate it since I think it would be an important variable to include.
